DOTWEB5.0(OJ7)
==============

Dotweb5  is  a  most standard  ,secure, and  Advanced Technology invented  by wilmix jemin.


DOTWEB5.0(OJ7) Programming Language: An Overview
============================================

DOTWEB5.0 is a programming language developed by Wilmix Jemin J in 2016. It was built using C/C++, and DOTWEB3.0 technologies. 
DOTWEB5.0 is otherwise known  as  DOTWEB5.0(OJ7). Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) invented by wilmix jemin j  
This language introduces several advanced features and supports the development of Remote-X applications, which will be discussed in detail later.
DOTWEB5.0 is primarily designed for creating data structures, console-based applications integrated with WNoSQL databases, and is also applicable in web
and Remote-X application development. It incorporates advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. However, the Windows-based application interface 
for DOTWEB5.0 is available only through JDollarShell, not as a native component of DOTWEB5.0 itself.

The language introduces innovative concepts such as Bucket and Extend. In JDollarShell, only the J$Shell graphical user interface (GUI) and graphics components are available.
Remote-X applications developed using DOTWEB5.0 are considered more advanced than those built with Python or other existing programming languages. As such, it represents a 
shift away from traditional web application paradigms.Remote-X applications are proprietary and not open source. They differ fundamentally from standard web applications—a 
distinction also introduced by Wilmix Jemin J. It is important to note that Remote-X applications and Remote Web Applications are not the same. In fact, Remote Web Applications
are considered more advanced than Remote-X applications. Both are designed with confidentiality in mind, protecting against unauthorized access or replication by malicious actors or competitors.
DOTWEB5.0 also supports code obfuscation and security features, making it both secure and easy to learn. 
The platform introduces OJ7, which stands for Jemin Advanced Virtual Application. OJ7 is positioned as being more advanced than Python and other programming languages.
The Linux version of DOTWEB5.0 was implemented in 2021 using C/C++, and DOTWEB3.0.

DOTWEB5.0 with Machine Learning and Data Science: Historical Overview
=====================================================================

The J@ framework from JDollar Part 2 (J$ Part 2) was originally focused on mathematical statistics and data science.
These concepts have since been updated and integrated into DOTWEB5.0, leaving only the mathematical statistics component in J@ under JDollar Part 2.
As a result, JDollar (J$) has contributed its core concepts to the development of DOTWEB5.0.
Currently, JDollar (J$) holds a conceptual rank of Z′′′′′, and it is projected to reach Z′′′′′′′′′′′ after version 10 and beyond. 
Notably, JDollar (J$) adopted machine learning and data science principles even before Python did. However, JDollar (J$), DOTWEB5.0, 
and other WRIT programming languages do not focus on artificial intelligence or robotics development.

Divisions of DOTWEB5.0 Programming Language
============================================

DOTWEB5.0 is categorized into six distinct divisions:
- Scroll Server with Java/J2EE, DOTWEB5.0, and JDK 1.8 Compiler
Note: The DOTWEB5.0 compiler is not used in this configuration. Instead, JDK 1.8 is employed due to compatibility with frameworks like Hibernate, MyBatis, Java Spring, and EJB. DOTWEB5.0 is primarily used to enhance security within the Java/J2EE platform. However, JDK 1.8 and its subsequent versions are not supported by the DOTWEB5.0 compiler.
JSP and Servlets are not functional in Scroll Server, but EJB and JMS are supported. Sample Hibernate implementations will be available on GitHub.

DOTWEB5.0 Syntax with OakJava7 Machine Learning Integration
===========================================================
Sample Program Structure
========================
<!-- Beginning of OakJava7 ML Program -->
<OJ7ML>
 <DESIGN  SRC='
      public static void Methods1() {
        <PRINTLN>("");
      }
    '>
  </DESIGN>

  <OakJava7  Package="ML" Database="wnosql" J7Lib="{Java7ML}" Names="sampleml1,misctype1"  Type="exe"
    
    MAIN='
      Methods1();
      Methods2();
      ?>
    '

    LOGIC='
      public static void Method2() {
        // Write business logic here
      }
    '
  >
  </OakJava7>

</OJ7ML>
<!-- End of OakJava7 ML Program -->


Note:
====

  -- Define the package name and database 
  -- Always use "wnosql" as the default database value 
  -- Specify OakJava7 library files for machine learning in J7Lib (e.g., Java7ML) 
  -- Use "ML" as the package name, "sampleml1" as the namespace, and "misctype1" as the class name
  -- Set the output type as either .exe or .dll 


Explanation
===========

This syntax demonstrates how to build a machine learning program using the OakJava7 framework within DOTWEB5.0. 
When compiled, it automatically converts into an optimized DOTWEB5.0 .web file, along with .exe and .ojava7 outputs.
You can test the machine learning program using the generated .web code.
The <OJ7ML> tag serves as a user-friendly framework, resembling XML structure with embedded logic and design.
It simplifies the development of dynamic web pages by combining database integration, GUI design, business logic,
and DOTWEB5.0 servlets. You can also generate .dll files by setting the Type attribute to "dll".
Using "exe" as the Type will produce both .exe and .ojava7 files upon compilation.

Why Is DOTWEB5.0 Syntax Similar to <JAVA> or <JAVA7>?
=====================================================
The syntax design of DOTWEB5.0 intentionally mirrors Java-style tags like <JAVA> and <JAVA7> to maintain familiarity for developers.
However, unlike Java, DOTWEB5.0 offers robust code security. Java source code can be easily extracted by hackers using decompilers,
whereas DOTWEB5.0 prevents such vulnerabilities.
DOTWEB5.0 is often used alongside Java/J2EE frameworks, enhancing their security and performance. While Java and DOTWEB5.0 coexist 
in the software development ecosystem, DOTWEB5.0 belongs to the "Java-type" family but provides significantly stronger protection for web applications.
