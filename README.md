DOTWEB5.0
===========

DOTWEB5.0 Programming Language is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year 2016 in  Java ,C/C++, DOTWEB3.0. 
and DOTWEB5.0 has more Advantages + remote-x apps which will be described later.
and  it  is   focused  on   creating  DataStructures,Console Application with Wnosql DB, and
 used  in  web application and Used in Remote X application  and  it  has  Advanced Oops.But DOTWEB5.0 windows application is  present in JDollarShell
 not present in DOTWEB5.0. DOTWEB5.0 has Advanced concept like Bucket,Extend,etc. But in JdollarShell only J$Shell GUI,Graphics are
 found. Remote X application is Advanced than Python Webapplication,and all programming Languages.So Say Good bye to olden web application.

 
 It is used in Remote X application which is not opensource.Because Remote X application is
different from webapplication and this concept is  invented by Wilmix Jemin j.This Remote X application and
Remote web Application are not one. Remote web application is advanced than  remote X application.
This  Remote X Application and  Remote Webapplication is  confidental from illegal hackers or another illegal persons who
want to copy all my features in their research product and they will implement it.

 It  also  supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it  is Learnable.It is  easy to learn.
OJ7   means   Jemin  Advanced  Virtual  Application.
OJ7   is  even   Advanced   than  Python Programming  language and  all programming Languages.
DOTWEB5.0 Linux version  is  implemented  in  C/C++, Java,Dotweb3.0 at  year  2021.  



Definition:
==========

â€œDOTWEB5.0  is  meant  for  obfuscation, Code Security, Learnable,jclass type software, Advanced , used  in
Software  development, web application with machine learning  , and  it  symbolizes  
STAR  symbol,  used  in  applications  like   consolee and  used  with  java/j2ee  framework  like

About the Author Wilmix jemin j
===============================

Author has 15 years Total IT exp.
And he have used C/C++,Java,Dotnet Programming Languages
in the projects.At year 2003 he invented 
Webc mini compiler.Later gaining experience
in Java , Dotnet ,and C/C++.By his experience he invent Oakjava7
programming Language in year 2013.
Dotweb5.0 follows the same code of OakJava7 P.L.
And remaining 50% of DOTWEB5.0 take only 2 years time
to finish it.So at year 2016 he invented 
DOTWEB5.0. 


ABOUT DOTWEB5.0
===============


DOTWEB5.0 Programming  Language   is
  which is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2016 in  java ,DOTWEB3.0.
This   two  versions  of  JAVA  (Jdk1.8,jdk1.7)  failed  that  is  using  JAD  decompiler  we  can   
easily  take   the  source   code.. But using DOTWEB5.0  we  can't take the code.
We  felt   thanks  to my  best  friends  venkat  friend ,  github ,  and  all  for  their   support..
DOTWEB5.0 has one Module related to OakJava7. This Machine learning and Datascience features are
borrrowed from OakJava7.Because OakJava7 is only focused on Remote Web Application.
Where as DOTWEB5.0 is focused on Remote X Application.That OJ7 is also known as
OakJava7. So we can call DOTWEB5.0 programming language as DOTWEB5.0(OJ7).


ADVANTAGES of DOTWEB5.0
=======================

a) OJ7 behaves like his parent java and Dotweb3.0

java fails completly in code security. 

but java(jdk1.8,jdk1.7) is used with JREE in linux platform.To
maintain Stable so DOTWEB5.0 is used with Java for Remote -X Application.

b) OJ7 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) OJ7 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) OJ7 also supports CDollar Library concepts.

e) OJ7 is used to create games which cannot be achieved in GDollar.

f) OJ7 also includes Java oops concepts.

g) OJ7 also follows attractive syntax.

h) OJ7 have  100% oops concepts. 

i) OJ7 is used with DotWeb3.0,CWEB section, and  Java.

j) DOTWEB5.0  provides high security for  Web / Remote-X application

k) DOTWEB5.0 contains Optimized code.
l) DOTWEB5.0 is  learnable.

m)   In  case  of  programming  language  like  C# or Java or PHP or Python or  anyother P.L  ; 
source  code  can be  taken  using  code reflector  for c++, C#. For  Java , Code  can  be  taken using  JAD compiler 
, and for  other programming  language. For Php,Python  Code security  is  absent. 
.But  DOTWEB5.0  source  code  cannot  be  taken . So DOTWEB5.0 is the  most  securable  programming 
Language. So no need   to worry  about   code  security. DOTWEB5.0 will work in
Windows and Linux type  platforms.

Note: You  can see remaining  advantages  in  DOTWEB5.0 Website which is given below....
This tutorial website  is under  construction.


n) It has  High security Remote -X Application , High security Webapplications ,Other Advantages,Good Quality,
and  Other Concepts  

Note: DOTWEB5.0  has  more  advantages than i  given  above..





Did DOTWEB5.0 has limitations?
===============================





No,DOTWEB5.0 did not have any limitations.The reasons for it are given below...


1) Once you study Java/j2ee you can easily

write a  program in DOTWEB5.0.


2) DOTWEB5.0 is a new Programming Language

in SIT field.A useless software should be

replaced by a good software. As we change

our shirt every day so C/C++,pascal,foxpro or olden 

softwares  should be replaced by new one.This

is what SIT focus. Computer field should be a

learnable field. 


3) DOTWEB5.0 did not focus on Robotics design.
Because it will replace Man by Robots is not Good a thing.
Why because all human will be under control of
a Robot.This human beings are created by God
and Computer field jobs should be  used  for humans and not used for
Robots.Robots will decrease many jobs in computer field.And
Robots will bring Famines in Any country.So as a
Author, Iam not involved in supporting
this illegal Robotics design.


4) Remote X application is a new concept.After machine learning,etc, all are released.

In DOTWEB5.0 Remote X application we can use

with java framework like Hibernate,JPA,and Jdk compiler

like Jdk1.8,Java 11, and Jdk17. But DOTWEB5.0 will work faster

than C/C++.For Remote X application instead we use

<WEB> syntax , tech guys should use <J7Remote> syntax.

If you know OJ7UA framework then it is very easy

to focus DOTWEB5.0 Remote X application.only the

Syntax <WEB>  is  replaced by   <J7Remote>


remaining syntax of .oj7ua or .web will not change.

So their is no new to learn for DOTWEB5.0 Remote X application. So learning DOTWEB5.0 Remote X application may not need  any additional effort.

5) DOTWEB5.0 has Good performance. Because it is faster

and have Good Memory Management. In enterprise edition you can learn

depth about DOTWEB5.0 memory management topics. So DOTWEB5.0 saves time

and it has Good performance.

6) DOTWEB5.0 did not have any compactibility issues,

why because it will work on any browsers.

7) DOTWEB5.0 is the Powerful/Versalite programming

language greater than all Programming languages

in the world.It will work without any support of

any Programming language.DOTWEB5.0 is the 12 times

greater than web1.0 programming langauge.

DOTWEB5.0 is not a competitor to other programming

language.
From this we understood DOTWEB5.0 P.L did not have any limitations
and it avoids Robots.


 ABOUT  DOTWEB5.0 with MachineLearning and  Datascience History
==============================================================

J@ framework from  J$part2 focused for Mathematical statistics and  Datascience.
and  such  concept is removed already  and  updated  in  DOTWEB5.0...
and  now  only  mathematical  statistics concept  is  now found in j@  at  JDollarpart2..
So  J$ give his  concept to  DOTWEB5.0.
Now JDollar(J$)  real  rank  is  Rank z'''''. In future
JDollar(J$) real rank after version 10 it will come up to  Rank Z''''''''''' and so on.
So  JDollar(J$)  use   machine learning and  datascience before python
uses  machine learning and  datascience.
Jdollar(J$),DOTWEB5.0 and  all other  writ  programming language
is  not  concenterated  in  AI  and  creating robots.

About DOTWEB5.0 Programming Language Divisions
==============================================

DOTWEB5.0 is  divided  into  6 types



i) Scroll Server with  Java/j2ee,DOTWEB5.0, and Java (jdk1.8) compiler 

(Note: Here DOTWEB5.0 compiler is not used,instead of that Jdk1.8 compiler is used
with ScrollServer.Because  Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring are written in Jdk1.8 
That's why DOTWEB5.0 compiler is not match with java/j2ee frameworks
Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring ,and EJB. But DOTWEB5.0 will
be  used  in case of providing security for Java/J2ee platform.
so Jdk1.8 versions and  next versions of  Jdk1.8 will not be
supported to be used with DOTWEB5.0 compiler.
Here Jsp ,and Servlet will not work in Scroll Server.
but EJB and JMS will work. You can see the sample for hibernate in SAMPLES at github
that i will tell later.

(Sample-2:Topic: Write   a OJ7 program  with Scroll Program,
here Jdk1.8 compiler is focused).
(We advice Java Spring should optimize the source code.So Java(jdk1.8) 
professionals are permited to be used with most popular server which is Scroll Server.
)

iii) Scroll Server with (.java7) with DOTWEB5.0 compiler

iv) Machine Learning and  data Science with  UserFriendly frameworks (OJ7UA).

v) DOTWEB5.0  Advanced Samples with  (.web) and  DOTWEB5.0 Console Application.

vi) DOTWEB5.0  with Remote X Application (Advanced Application) ( Not released now, i will come later).




======================================================

Doubtful FAQS?
==============


1) Can DOTWEB5.0 compiler work  with  Jdk1.8 and java/j2ee frameworks ?

No.

2) Can DOTWEB5.0 compiler compile Jdk1.8 programs ?

No, It will not accept jdk1.8 and other jdk1.8 versions.

3) Is DOTWEB5.0 is the competitor of Java/J2ee?

No , DOTWEB5.0 business is very different when compared

to Oracle business.

4) Is DOTWEB5.0 work as a Standalone application?

Yes, it will work without the help of Java/J2ee applications.


5) Is DOTWEB5.0 a high security Programming Language?

Yes.


===================================================================


Why DOTWEB5.0 is the best and top programming language than python p.l?
======================================================================

i) Both DOTWEB5.0 and java/j2ee  is like  english fluent language.

but python is not a english fluent language.

ii) Using DOTWEB5.0  we can reduce the  lines of code.

python is not  easy for the  developers to focus  when it reduce the lines of  code...

iii) DOTWEB5.0 and Java/j2ee follow camel case and can be adjusted  at any style with beautiful arrangement 

using Intellij.But Python is failed in indentation.

iv) DOTWEB5.0 is an beautiful programming language with attractive syntax and with few lines of code than python programming Language.

v) DOTWEB5.0 module Oakjava8 is  best  in Mobile computing.


Note:  
=====

As  only  25%  of   DOTWEB5.0   features  is  published  for
professionals  but  many  features  of  DOTWEB5.0   is  hidden  from   users..
Since   they  may    copy    the  features   and  try  to  implement  it...

DOTWEB5.0  is not  released  now. It has no  bugs.

In DOTWEB5.0  first version itself  we will cover 
70%  the  concepts of  Machine learning and DataScience.
and  remaining concepts will be covered in DOTWEB5.0 second version.

About the DOTWEB5.0  Programming Language
=========================================


Note: I spent 2 years  to  Design and  create  this DOTWEB5.0 programming language.
Because OJ7 only takes 5  years. Mostly OJ7 concepts are covered 
in DOTWEB5.0.So 50% is over for Dotweb5.0, another 50 % for Dotweb5.0 is invented at year 2016.
but unwanted hackers attack my website without any reason. That's why iam delayed.
DOTWEB5.0 programming language is not easy to design and invent it. To invent 
DOTWEB5.0 programming language  is very hard...


Difference between Java(Jdk1.8) and DOTWEB5.0 ?
===============================================

Both Java and DOTWEB5.0 is used in webapplication and
console application.But Java follows cloudcomputing
DOTWEB5.0 follows Remote-X Application.DOTWEB5.0 is
not used to create a software like VB.net and
Java Swing. DOTWEB5.0 is used only with java frameworks like hibernate
and Mybatics, it is not used with Java Spring ,the reason is Java Spring code is
very bulk. This Java Spring webapplication standalone application
is very slow when compare to Node.js,DOTWEB5.0.
DOTWEB5.0 is invented in Dotweb3.0,C/C++, and java.Java Spring
takes more time to develop a webapplication when compared to DOTWEB5.0,Node.js.
And DOTWEB5.0 has Advanced datastructures when compare to Java(Jdk1.8).
eg) Pipe,Bag,etc.Remember DOTWEB5.0 is not the competitor for Java,C#,
python,etc. DOTWEB5.0 is an interactive programming language. Java is
not a interactive programming Language.DOTWEB5.0 is used in MachineLearning,
Datascience,mobile application,and single page application.
It supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it is Learnable.
DOTWEB5.0 follows attractive and beautiful Userfriendly framework
(.oj7ua).DOTWEB5.0 follows Shortest  function Statements.Dotweb5.0 is
focus on Code Security.DOTWEB5.0 is used with WNOSQL Database which  
provides high security...DOTWEB5.0 is a standalone programming
language.That is without help of any available java frameworks 
DOTWEB5.0 will able to create  webapplication,etc.DOTWEB5.0 is
a Pure OOPS Programming Language. And Java/j2ee is not a
Pure OOPS Programming Language.DOTWEB5.0 saves  time and  cost
and DOTWEB5.0 is a highest securable programming language.
DOTWEB5.0 will compile and run the DOTWEB5.0 program
at the same time. but Java(Jdk1.8) can't do it.






Who may  focus DOTWEB5.0 ?
==================================
 For DOTWEB5.0 ,DOTWEB5.0 machinelearning,DOTWEB5.0 datascience only C or  C++ or C# & Dotnet or Java/j2ee

Professionals  can focus and  read the samples. Because it is designed like this.

Note: All DOTWEB5.0  documents  are  under  construction.So don't read it now ,because it will confuse you.


Important Note:
================
This  GNUGPL3  license  is  for  only  Professional  Edition with  DOTWEB5.0 Tutorial. But  enterprise  edition 
 is  not  free that  is  MIT licensed. since DOTWEB5.0 Programming Language  is a  Powerful Programming Language
  and  it  is  dual Licensed invented  by  wilmix jemin j (Jemin Information Technology).





Syntax for DOTWEB5.0 Machine Learning
=====================================


// Beginning of DOTWEB5.0 ML Program

 <OJ7ML> 

  
<DESIGN  



// Design is the HTML GUI or variable declarations or method declarations


SRC='

// Method declarations

public static void Methods1()
{




j7out.println("");






}



'> 


//Close Design for GUI

</DESIGN>	

//Mention name of Package value in Package always mention wnosql as a default value for the Database. 

// Mention DOTWEB5.0 library files for machine Learning  in J7Lib eg) Java7ML 

// Mention Package as ML , Names as sampleml1 for namespace name and class name as misctype1

// Mention Type as .exe or .dll 

<DOTWEB5 Package='ML' Database='wnosql' J7Lib='{Java7ML}' Names='sampleml1,misctype1' Type='exe'  




//Mention MAIN section for Dotweb5.0 main program ie) public void main() can be  written as MAIN

// Mention what are the Business logic methods inside the main program eg) Methods1(),Methods2() in the MAIN section

 MAIN=' 


// Methods call

Methods1();
Methods2();









// This ( ?> ) is  equivalent to }}.Close the Main Section
?>
'
//LOGIC sections represent Business Logic for Dotweb5.0
LOGIC=' 

  
//Business logic methods
public static void Method2()

{

<!----- write Business Logic and  use Dotweb5.0 Servlet ----!>

}





// Close the Logic section
'>


// Close  the Dotweb5.0 program 
</DOTWEB5>


// End of Dotweb5.0 Program
</OJ7ML>





Explanation 
============

Here when you code the Machine Learning program  using this syntax, it will automatically convert to
DOTWEB5.0 program ie(.web) . And you will get a optimized DOTWEB5.0 (.web) code and .exe and .ojava7 files.
You can also test the  DOTWEB5 Machine Learning program using (.web) code...So when we notice that here <OJ7ML> 
act like a DOTWEB5 user friendly framework. It act like a XML syntax with data present inside it.
This Machine Learning program (<OJ7ML) will automatically generate (.web). This (<OJ7ML>) 
program has attractive syntax.So it is considered as a DOTWEB5 advanced framework or DOTWEB5.0 Machine learning framework.
 I reduces the pain of writing program for (.web).
And It saves time and  cost.The Full form of <OJ7ML> program is "DOTWEB5.0 MACHINELEARNING". 
It is used for Dynamic Webpages construction ie) DB with GUI + Business Logic and DOTWEB5 Servlet.
We can also generate .dll  using this syntax by using .dll value as a Type.
So when you include .exe value as a Type means when you compile the DOTWEB5.0
it will generate the  .exe files and  .ojava7 files.




===========================================



<BR><BR>



Why DOTWEB5.0 syntax is created like <JAVA> or  <JAVA7> ?
<BR>

Because Java fails in code security,Security.If a 
person write java program , Java Source code
will be taken by  hackers ,etc.
So DOTWEB5.0 is  used  with Java/j2ee.
Java is used with DOTWEB5.0
so the <JAVA> or  <JAVA7> syntax is  focused 
for DOTWEB5.0 Programming Language.
So we can say two (Java and  DOTWEB5.0 )
is  in our computer field market.
So we can say DOTWEB5.0 is the 
Java type  group.DOTWEB5.0 provides
high security where java becomes like 
a Securable software for webapplication.When we use
Java with DOTWEB5.0.

This document is under  construction. DOTWEB5.0 Website is  changed  as  a  beautiful webpage.
Samples ,Advanced samples, Machine learning, Datascience etc  is under construction.
Even gooogle site is mostly affected by Hackers,who can steel the code and attack it.
 So Google site is not focused.We will provide securable url it can determine 
the persons ,etc visiting the website.Due to this all tutorial documents will be
available at Github.Later we will  change in PDF format for
